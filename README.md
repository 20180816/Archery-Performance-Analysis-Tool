ArcheryVis: A Tool for Analyzing and Visualizing
Archery Performance Data

We present ArcheryVis, a tool for analyzing and visualizing
archery performance data collected from two elementary school trainees
over a year. The goals are to digitally archive their training target papers,
automatically detect and calibrate shots, and analyze their performance
via a visual interface. We achieve automatic shot detection using a deep
neural network, compute scores and relevant statistical measures, and
design coordinated multiple views for interactive user exploration. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of ArcheryVis.
